Ideas for features

For enhancing your `Menu` class and making it more versatile and user-friendly, consider the following ideas:

1. **Dynamic Menu Updates**: Allow adding and removing menu items dynamically. This feature can be useful for applications where the menu options might change based on the state of the application or user permissions.

2. **Menu Navigation History**: Implement a navigation history stack to enable a "back" functionality, allowing users to return to the previous menu easily.

3. **Input Validation and Error Handling**: Provide built-in support for input validation and error handling to ensure that user inputs are valid and to manage incorrect inputs gracefully.

4. **Customizable Menu Presentation**: Offer customization options for how menus and sub-menus are displayed, such as custom prefixes, bullet points, or colors for menu items.

5. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature that allows users to search for menu items by keywords, making it easier to navigate through large menus.

6. **Accessibility Features**: Add accessibility features, such as keyboard shortcuts for menu items and support for screen readers, to make the menu more accessible to all users.

7. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support for internationalization to allow menus to be displayed in different languages based on user preferences or system settings.

8. **Help System**: Integrate a help system that provides descriptions or help text for each menu item, which can be displayed on demand.

9. **Event Hooks**: Allow developers to attach event hooks for menu actions, such as on_menu_open, on_menu_close, or on_item_selected, providing more flexibility in handling menu interactions.

10. **Configuration Files**: Support loading menu structures from configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) to separate the menu configuration from the application logic, making it easier to update menus without changing the code.

11. configure menu layout (e.g., vertical, horizontal, grid) and alignment (e.g., left, center, right) to customize the appearance of the menu. also the visual style e.g. |, -, *, custom characters ect.

Implementing these features would significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of your `Menu` class, making it a more powerful tool for developing console-based applications.
